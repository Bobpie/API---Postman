No Auth:

If the particular request or collection doesnot require any auth, then use No Auth

Basic Authentication:

* This basically requires username and password for the authentication.
* This is handled by HTTP Headers itself, so it doesnot require any handshake.
* The limitation is that, unless you route the transaction through SSL, it will not be secure.  There may be a middle man breech to the API through COPY Cat HTTP header.
* Also, if it routed through SSL, it will be slower in response time.  
* {And even ignoring that, in its base form, HTTP is not encrypted in any way. It is encapsulated in base64, and is often erroneously proclaimed as encrypted due to this.}
* {HTTP Basic Authentication does have its place. In an internal network, especially in IoT situations where speed is of no essence, having an HTTP Basic Authentication system is acceptable as a balance between cost of implementation and actual function. As a general authentication solution, however, HTTP Basic Authentication should be seldom used in its base form.}

SSL: Secure Sockets Layer 

Note: These Auth is applicable in both request level as well as Collection level.  If you give the auth in the collection level, select the type of auth as Inherit from the parent option.
