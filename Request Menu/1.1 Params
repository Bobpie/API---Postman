Params:
Params helps us in various factors in API Testing. Since I am learning phase, will update asap.

Types of Params:
1) Query Params
2) Request Params
3) Form Params
4) Path Params

Query Params:

* It helps us filter the data in column wise.  you can customise your response as per your need and you can see that in the response board. 
* It will be in key value pair and you can give a brief description about the filter that you have applied.  
* Mostly, the API documentation will give you the key from which we can filter the params.
* Values are the names of the columns that you want to see.  
* Key in the Query params in unique. we cannot give it again. 
* We can filter the row data using the key and value of each response in the next params
* While you are filtering the rows, you can give 2 or more conditions to filter, but you can inclusively add the conditions. You will not be able to have a choice of condition
* In nutshell, you can have and in between condition & you can not use or in between the conditions in Postman {} but can be achieved by Code REST.
