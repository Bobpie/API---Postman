URL:
* The URL of the entry point needs to be communicated to API clients so that they can find the API.
* URLs should never be constructed by an API client. Instead, the client should only follow links that are generated by the API itself.
URL	Description
/api	The API entry point
/api/:coll	A top-level collection named “coll”
/api/:coll/:id	The resource “id” inside collection “coll”
/api/:coll/:id/:subcoll	Sub-collection “subcoll” under resource “id”
/api/:coll/:id/:subcoll/:subid	The resource “subid” inside “subcoll”


Components of a URL:
Server:  Host name/ Port number where the API is hosted
Port number:  Port number where the API is listening to (Default port number is 80)
Resources: Simply the end point.  Contains the details about the API or the folder where I want to interact  




Endpoint: 
* An API endpoint is the point of entry in a communication channel when two systems are interacting.
* Endpoints help to depict the exact location of the resources to be accessed by API and also play a vital role in ensuring that the software which is interacting with the API is functioning correctly.

How Are API Endpoints Secured?
1. Utilize one-way password hashing
2. Make HTTPS your only option
3. Institute rate limiting
4. Solid authentication {the Oath2 system is preferred since it segregates accounts into various resources and permits limited access to the token bearer}
5. Input validation is crucial
