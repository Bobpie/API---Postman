NEW Menu

New Menu help you to create certain components of PostMan. In which, basically you can create the following entities.
  * Collection (Project -> Collection of folders/requests)
  * Request (Transaction)
  * Environment
  
  Collections:
  Collections in postman is generally contains requests. It helps us organise the requests that we send or recieve to the API.  
  Collection also capable of having folders/sub-folders to organise the requests.
  
  Request:
  Request is the transaction, that we intract with the API for retrieving/writing data.
  With my previous knowledge, the following type of requests are available.
  
  GET, POST, PUT, UPDATE, PATCH,....
  
  
  So, Basically create a collection -> which is equivalent to create a project for writing code specific to one application.
  
  I have created a Collection and followed by a folder named incident. Here I am saving the requests that are belonging to the Incident module
